# Fix the error from the first meeting about the contents of the assessment task.
The purpose for this assessment task:  
use stellar population (metallicities [Fe/H] and ages) and dynamical information to identify potentially accreted globular clusters. Consider if there are some globular clusters that stand out in the age metallicity relation or that do not rotate with the bulk of other globular clusters. 
Consider what the above findings might mean for how the Milky Way formed and how many of its globular clusters could be accreted and how many may have formed within the Milky Way. Consider what further tests could be performed to delineate various possible formation scenarios.
