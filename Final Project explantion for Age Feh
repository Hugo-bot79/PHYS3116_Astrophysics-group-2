#Forbes & Bridges (2010) and Belokurov & Kravtsov (2023) show that the age–metallicity relation of Milky Way globular clusters divides into two distinct trends.

#The old, metal-poor clusters (top-left) likely formed ex situ, in dwarf galaxies that were later accreted by the Milky Way.

#The younger, metal-rich clusters (bottom-right) were probably formed in situ, within the Galaxy itself as it chemically evolved.

#The scatter in this diagram highlights chemical outliers — clusters that are unusually metal-poor for their age.
#These deviant points suggest external origins, since dwarf galaxies generally undergo slower chemical enrichment than the Milky Way.

#Interpretation:
#This pattern provides chemical evidence of hierarchical assembly — showing that part of the Milky Way’s halo was built through the accretion of smaller systems rather than single collapse.
Clusters such as NGC 7078 (M15) and NGC 7099 (M30) are examples of these old, low-[Fe/H] accreted systems."
