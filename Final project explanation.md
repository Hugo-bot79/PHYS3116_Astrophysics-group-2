# What can these graphs tell us about accreted cluters? 
# 1. According to Belokurov & Kravtsov (2023), the clusters with larger galactic radius most likely originated from the outer halo or have been accreted from the dwarf galaxies. 
# 2. Marsakov et al. (2019) suggest that in-situ clusters are more luminous, so that they will have lower absolute magnitude.  
# 3. McGill et al. (2025) suggest that accreted clusters often have HBtype > 0.85, which indicate these clusters are old, metal-poor stellar populations. Therefore, applying the filter further supports the identification of accreted clusters. 
# Therefore, the outliers from the graphs with  high galactic radius and low absolute magnitude like M5053, M288 in this graph are possible candidates, but further information is required to confirm.

# However, there are several limitations for the project.
# 1. Some known accreted clusters like Trezan8 were excluded, as we only analyze NGC clusters. And most of these cluster are originated from the Milky Way based on our graphs. This limits the sample diversity. 
# 2. Clusters with large galactic radius and larger absolute magnitude are not necessarily accreted clusters. Additionally, some in-situ clusters are old and metal poor.
# 3. Therefore, to improve accuracy, kinematic data will be required to support the identification.
# Therefore, further test such as plot the graph of root of virial velocity plus vertial velocity versus Azimuthal velocity as suggested by Marsakov et al. (2019) and calculate the mass to light ratio by using the virial theorem and absolute magnitude to examine the mass distribution is suggested.
